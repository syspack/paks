⭐️ [Documentation](https://syspack.github.io/paks) ⭐️

With paks you can save the state of your current container, and issue other 
commands to it while developing. The sibling of this library is [syspack/pack](https://github.com/syspack/pack)
which is implemented in Go.

## TODO

- add commands to save exported env to named env, and load named env
- get envar from the host
- some commands to interact with a registry?
- allow user to define custom commands on fly for container?
- add singularity backend?
- can we create some packaged thing with container, sbom?
- can we add custom config file from remote? pakages? `#load <commandset>`
- write up security issues

🚧️ **under development** 🚧️
