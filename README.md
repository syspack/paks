> Paks is a developer wrapper for containers 📦️ (in Python)

⭐️ [Documentation](https://syspack.github.io/paks) ⭐️

With paks you can save the state of your current container, and issue other 
commands to it while developing. The sibling of this library is [syspack/pack](https://github.com/syspack/pack)
which is implemented in Go.

## TODO

- add equivalent container backends
- translate commands over to run
- add additional commands with a registry?
- allow user to define custom commands on fly for container
- can we create some packaged thing with container, sbom?
- can we add custom config file from remote? pakages?

🚧️ **under development** 🚧️
