Paks is a community framework for container interactions üì¶Ô∏è

Paks provides a core set of commands to help you manage your container state or 
get quick access to metadata without leaving your development environment.
It is similar to `syspack/pack <https://github.com/syspack/paks>`_, but implemented in a different
language, intentionally to allow for contribution from the larger scientific community that 
embraces Python. With Paks you can:

 - quickly ``#save`` your development container while you are shelled into it working.
 - develop or use custom recipes or actions for your containers.
 
You can see different recipes for interactions under the `pakages <https://github.com/pakages>`_ organization.
